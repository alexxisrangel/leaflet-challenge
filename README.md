# leaflet-challenge

Summary 

With this project I used data from USGS GeoJSON Feed and I collected all earthquakes that occured within the last 7 days. I then organized and plotted the data on a world map using Leaflet.

In my final product I have circle that represents each earthquake. The size and color of each circle is determined by the earthquake’s magnitude and depth. 

Tools 

Tools I used for this project: 
•	JavaScript Leaflet were used to generate the map
•	HTML was used to get the map on a web browser and CSS to style the map 
 

Data
 
The data I used was from United States Geological Survey (USGS). They are responsible for providing data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environments, and the impacts of climate and land-use change. https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php
